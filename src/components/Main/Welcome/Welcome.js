            <h1>Welcome to the Tasmanian Trouts AFL club homepage!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the official webpage of the Tasmanian Trouts
                    AFL club. This is your central resource for all things 
                    Tasmanian Trouts as we look to join the Australian Football League in 2023! 
                    As the latest of the AFL's expansion clubs and the very first AFL club based in Tasmania
                    we are so excited to bring high quality Footy to the state we love so much. We have assembled 
                    some of the best talent in the league from our very successful CEO and coaching staff right 
                    through to our playing group. As such we have high expectations and see the team winning a flag
                    in the next ten years!
                    If you're a Footy loving Tasmanian then pick up a membership and get behind the might Tasmanian Trouts.
                    We look forward to hearing you all cheer our team on in 2023! Go Trouts!
